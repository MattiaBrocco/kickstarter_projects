Comparison of ML algorithms for a binary classification task


Kickstarter is a great crowdfunding platform
used worldwide. To date it has been used to
raise more than 5 billion dollars and with a
total of nearly 200.000 successfully funded projects,
with a success rate of 38% (SOURCE: Kickstarter).

Through a dataset found on Kaggle I've tried to
see if it was possible to predict the outcome
of a project (from 2018 to date) given its category,
the period of activity and the cash target of the project.

I wanted to conduct this work with Rstudio,
to deepen my knowledge on the syntax for ML algorithms,
specifically for binary classification tasks.
